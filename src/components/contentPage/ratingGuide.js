     <p className="text-normal text-neutral-900 leading-6 mb-6">
     People come to Peak to learn about workplace culture. We know that people won’t always agree, but we expect everyone on the site to treat one another and the platform honestly and respectfully. We’ve put together these general guidelines to help set the tone for discourse on the site—just in case. Please also read the additional guidelines below for specific types of content that you might contribute to the site.
     </p>
      <ul className="text-normal text-neutral-700 leading-6 ml-6 mb-6">
        <li className="list-disc">
          <strong className="font-semibold">Inappropriate content:</strong> Colorful language and imagery are fine, but there’s no place for threats, harassment, lewdness, hate speech, or other displays of bigotry.
        </li>
        <li className="list-disc">
          <strong className="font-semibold">Privacy:</strong> Don’t publicize people’s private information. For instance, don’t post other people’s full names unless you’re referring to someone who is commonly referred to by their full name.
        </li>
        <li className="list-disc">
          <strong className="font-semibold">Intellectual property:</strong> Don’t swipe content from other sites, users, or businesses. You’re here to have your voice heard, so write your own review.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-normal text-neutral-900 leading-6 mb-2">
      The best reviews are personal and reflect your working experience. Here are some additional thoughts for conscientious reviewers:

        <li className="list-disc">
          <strong className="font-semibold">Personal experience: </strong>We want to hear about your firsthand experience, not what you heard from your partner or co-worker, or what you saw in the news. Tell your own story without resorting to broad generalizations and conclusory allegations.
        </li>
        <li className="list-disc">
          <strong className="font-semibold">Accuracy: </strong>Make sure your review is factually correct. Feel free to air your opinions, but don’t exaggerate or misrepresent your experience. We don’t take sides when it comes to factual disputes, so we expect you to stand behind your review.
        </li>
        <li className="list-disc">
          <strong className="font-semibold">Demanding payment: </strong>Writing a review should be informative and meant to help the broader Peak community. You should not threaten to post or offer to remove a negative review as a way to extract payment.
